A simple note-taking application with interactive task prefixes and fuzzy search capabilities.

## How it works

1. **Configure tasks** in `tasks.json` with prefixes and descriptions
```json
[
  {
    "prefix": "1",
    "task": "Project A"
  },
  {
    "prefix": "2",
    "task": "Project B"
  }
  ...
]
```
2. **Take notes** by typing `PREFIX NOTE` (e.g., `1 Fix bug`)
3. **Search files** with `-f` flag or **search content** with `-s` flag using fzf
4. Notes are automatically saved to dated files in `$NOTES_DIR/month.year/day.month.year.txt`

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- uv (Python package manager)
- fzf (fuzzy finder)
- Text editor (vim, micro, nvim, etc.)

## Usage

```bash
# Take notes interactively
uv run noter.py

# Search files by name
uv run noter.py -f

# Search within file contents
uv run noter.py -s
```

>I highly recommended launching noter with a keybind!!!

My launch command:
`st -t noter -e sh -c 'cd /path/to/noter;uv run noter.py; exec $SHELL'`

Configure your editor and notes directory in `.env`:
```
NOTES_DIR= # Directory where notes are saved
NOTES_EDITOR= # Editor to open fzf files in
```

## Versions

Implementation details and specifications for each version are documented in the `versions/` directory:
- `v0.0.0.md` - Original specification.
- Everything after is generated by an LLM.
